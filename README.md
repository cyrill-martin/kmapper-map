# kmapper map

This is a two-file spaghetti version of the kmapper map shown on https://kmapper.herokuapp.com/articles/463950 - without article information, legend, or any click events. Most of the content of the js object in the file isn't even needed for the visualization. This is mainly a backup for myself. 
HTML - JavaScript (jQuery, D3.js)
